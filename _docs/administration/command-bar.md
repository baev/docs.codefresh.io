For seamless navigation without extra clicks, access tasks and features with Codefresh's Quick Search. 

## About the Quick Search

**Where**: Toolbar, top-left.  
**How**: Start typing in the first letters of what you're looking for, and then select the option or use the shortcut keys.

We are always adding more options, so stay tuned to our online announcements.

## Find features/settings
Whether it is a task, feature, a specific pipeline or build, find what you're looking for with Quick Search.
The results are synced to your permissions and account settings.

## Switch accounts
Use Quick Search to switch between Codefresh accounts. 
Instead of selecting the account to sign into from your avatar, stay where you are, and use our built-in action to switch accounts.

* In the Quick Search, start typing `accounts` to get the Switch Account action.
* Select it to see the list of accounts, and then either select or use auto-complete to select the account.

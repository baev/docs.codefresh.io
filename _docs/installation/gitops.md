Codefresh has several modes for working with GitOps applications

* The easiest way to get started is to use [a hosted GitOps runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hosted-runtime/)
* You can install [your own GitOps runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops/). in your own cluster
* You can add [external clusters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/managed-cluster/) to any runtime (hosted or private)

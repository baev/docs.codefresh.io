The doc site includes documentation for both Codefresh Pipelines and Codefresh GitOps powered by Argo CD.  
We have merged and moved content to accommodate both modules.  

 
Notes:
* **Quick Starts**
  We have created different quick starts for Codefresh pipelines and GitOps to get you up and running with both. 

* **Pipelines**  
    * Documentation from Configure CD/CD Pipelines and Codefresh YAML has been merged into Pipelines.
    * Documentation for pipeline integrations are now in Pipeline Integrations.

* **Kubernetes and Helm deployments**  
  Documentation is now in Deployments > Kubernetes, and Deployments > Helm, respectively.

* **Changelog and What's New** 
    * The Changelog includes changes to Codefresh pipeline documentation.
    * The What's New includes changes to GitOps documentation.
  We plan to merge both into a single What's New article. Stay tuned for the announcement.

We want our documentation to help you, and look forward to your feedback as always to improve it.

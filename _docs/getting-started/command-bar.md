>**NOTE**:
>The Global Search & Navigation feature establishes an initial handshake request with the data source API on inital loading. The outcome of this request does not impact functionality, even in on-premises or air-gapped environments where it will fail.  
>Although your monitoring or alerting systems may flag it as a failure, you can safely disregard the failure notification.

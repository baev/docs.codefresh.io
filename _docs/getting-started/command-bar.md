Stay where you are in Codefresh to get to what you want! Be it navigation without extra clicks, actions such as switching accounts, finding entities such as pipelines or builds, Codefresh Quick Search is your answer. 

## About Quick Search

The Quick Search is always displayed in the toolbar, top-left.  
Start typing in the first letters of what you're looking for, and then select the option or use the shortcut keys.

> TIP:   
The results are synced to your permissions and account settings.

## Switch accounts
Use Quick Search to switch between Codefresh accounts. 
Instead of selecting the account to sign into from your avatar, stay where you are, and use our built-in action to switch accounts.

* In the Quick Search, start typing `accounts` to get the Switch Account action.
* Select it to see the list of accounts, and then either select or use auto-complete to select the account.

Codefresh offers several options when it comes to Helm packages and deployments:

* Codefresh offers a [built-in Helm repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/managed-helm-repository/) that you can use in your applications.
* You can connect your [own external Helm repositories]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-charts-and-repositories/) and then reference them by name everywhere in your pipelines
* You can [view the contents]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-releases-management/) of your Helm repositories and the charts they contain
* You can easily [store a chart]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/custom-helm-uploads/) or [deploy it]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/) from a Codefresh pipeline
* You can create [Helm environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-environment-promotion/) in a dedicated dashboard and promote releases between them.

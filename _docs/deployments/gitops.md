Codefresh has a native module for GitOps deployments powered by Argo CD and Argo Rollouts. It also has native support for Argo Events and Argo Workflows.

* Create a [GitOps Application]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/managed-helm-repository/) either from the GUI or the CLI.
* [Monitor your GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-charts-and-repositories/) and check their health status
* You can [edit/delete/rollback]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-releases-management/) applications while still keeping the state in Git.
* Perform [Canary releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-environment-promotion/) via the dedicated UI
